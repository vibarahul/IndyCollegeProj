This is a brief summary of some of the projects I undertook as part of my coursework at Indiana University while pursuing my Master's in Health Informatics. These included analyzing the efficacy of various drug types using "R," where I developed multinomial logistic regression models to identify significant differences between drug types. In another project, I analyzed mental health concerns and suicide rates using "SQL" and "Python," creating insightful visualizations. Furthermore, in a project involving the use of "XML" and clinical terminologies like LOINC, ICD, RxNorm, and CPT, I assessed the patient care process for a smoker and developed UML diagrams for data standardization and sharing. Lastly, I undertook a project that analyzed the relationship between dengue, mosquito specimens, and meteorological conditions using "Python," conducting correlation analysis and developing regression models.
